For example, if you detkill someone in CTF, you will immediately see "You killed Padawan" without needing to wait out the automatic scoreboard.</ul></div><p id=visuals><h4>Visuals</h4><div class="doc-section well well-sm"><ul><li class="spaced spaced-top">Third-person alpha for force power shaders (protect, etc) now matches value from the <em>Third-Person Alpha</em> cvar (<code>cg_thirdPersonAlpha</code>).<li class=spaced>Force sense now uses more saturated colors for improved visibility.<li class=spaced>Removed many annoying weapon shaking effects, as well as the horde of related cvars (<code>cg_bobPitch</code>, etc).<li class=spaced>Added a new 2D icon for siege ammo canisters for users who enable the <em>Simple Items</em> cvar (<code>cg_simpleItems</code>); base JKA just used the rocket ammo icon.<li class=spaced>Portable shields now use a new transparent shader for improved visibility.<li class=spaced>Removed ugly base JKA flickering effect from electrocution.<li class=spaced>Removed annoying damage effects from the first-person camera while not in scope.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA bug that caused the lightning 3 effect to appear as though its range were larger than it actually is.<li class=spaced>Added support for reworked drain and lightning on base_enhanced servers.</ul></div><p id=scoreboard><h4>Scoreboard</h4><div class="doc-section well well-sm"><ul><li class="spaced spaced-top">The base JKA scoreboard has been completely remade with a more minimal style.<li class=spaced>The scoreboard now supports up to 32 players (increased from 20).<li class=spaced>The lag icon shows next to a player's name if he has 999+ ping.<li class=spaced>You can now see scoreboard data any time while watching a demo; you don't need to wait until the person recording the demo opened their scoreboard or died.<li class=spaced>Removed annoying popup boxes from end of Siege round ("We are victorious!" etc); these messages are now integrated directly into the scoreboard.<li class=spaced>Removed bots from player count and changed bot ping to "BOT" text in grey color.<li class=spaced>During siege countdown, players are now properly listed under their chosen teams instead being treated like spectators.<li class=spaced>Simple win/lose messages clearly indicate match result in Siege; no more ambiguous/inconsistent "team 1" and "team 2."<li class=spaced>Erroneous "team 2 won the match!" message in Siege when both teams were held for maximum time replaced with "the match ended in a draw!" (requires compatible server mod such as base_entranced).<li class=spaced>JKChat users are now displayed on the scoreboard with a special icon.<li class=spaced>Deaths are now displayed in FFA and TFFA (either counted locally or received from the server, depending on the server).</ul></div><p id=menus><h4>Menus</h4><div class="doc-section well well-sm"><ul><li class="spaced spaced-top">Replaced the Profile button in the main menu with a new Reconnect button, which automatically remembers your previous server and password.<li class=spaced>Replaced the in-game "about" menu with a lightweight server browser for quickly connecting to your favorite servers.<li class=spaced>Added a "filter" textbox to the demos menu for searching for particular demo names.<li class=spaced>Added folder-browsing system for demos menu.<li class=spaced>Added mini class selection menu to ingame top bar menu in Siege on compatible servers.<li class=spaced>Added extra options for force power configuration to the force powers menu.<li class=spaced>You now see how many players are connected to a server on the loading screen.<li class=spaced>Simplified loading screen messages (e.g. just write "assets" instead of listing every weapon name).<li class=spaced>Added borderless windowed mode to setup menu (requires compatible executable).<li class=spaced>Added many modern resolutions (1080p, 1440p, 4K, ultrawide, etc) to setup menu.<li class=spaced>Added a button on the server list to toggle hiding of Movie Battles servers.<li class=spaced>Troll/advertisement servers are automatically hidden from the server list.<li class=spaced>Fixed force powers menu initialization and applying changes when exiting out without pressing apply.<li class=spaced>In CTF, added good CTF force power presets to the force powers menu.<li class=spaced>Added a CTF configuration menu to help new players configure useful CTF binds (e.g., common teamchat callouts).<li class=spaced>Siege classes now display starting health/armor separately from maximum health/armor.<li class=spaced>Enabled "air support" in voice chat menu.<li class=spaced>Intro videos are now automatically skipped.<li class=spaced>While connected to a base_entranced siege server, siege class information displayed in the "Join" menu now displays accurate data sent from the server.<li class=spaced>On compatible (base_enhanced) servers, a new tab has been added to the Call Vote menu, allowing easy access to new votes, e.g. Coin Toss, Reset Flags, etc.<li class=spaced>Pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> during demo playback now displays playback speed buttons.<li class=spaced>Numerous miscellaneous UI improvements.</ul></div><p id=misc><h4>Miscellaneous</h4><div class="doc-section well well-sm"><ul><li class="spaced spaced-top">Improved FPS by optimizing the code in several places.<li class=spaced>On servers that do not explicitly enable unlocked net settings, the <em>Max Packets</em> cvar (<code>cl_maxPackets</code>) is forced to 100 and the "Time Nudge cvar (<code>cl_timeNudge</code>) is limited to values between -30 and 30.<li class=spaced>You can now type the Euro symbol € in the chat. This replaces the useless/troll "WSI FONTS" character.<li class=spaced>Added "supercharge" sound+graphic for very long disruptor charge in Siege. (Disruptor <em>was always able</em> to charge for 5 seconds for super damage in Siege, but there was no visual/audio indication of this to the user beyond the standard 1.5 seconds charge effects.)<li class=spaced>You can press your "Force Seeing" (<code>force_seeing</code>) bind to toggle seeing players through walls as a spectator.<li class=spaced>Added unique obituary messages for concussion rifle, crush, and detpack kills (was obliterated by, was crushed by, was detpacked by).<li class=spaced>Added support for custom obituary messages (requires compatible server mod).<li class=spaced>Added prediction for all saber styles being able to kick/backflip on compatible servers, such as base_enhanced/base_entranced.<li class=spaced>Implemented proper clientside prediction for the "superman jump" fix on base_enhanced servers.<li class=spaced>Implemented proper clientside prediction for the sniper exploit fix on base_enhanced servers.<li class=spaced>Implemented proper clientside prediction for several features, fixes, and improvements on base_enhanced servers.<li class=spaced>Increased minimum FOV to 80 and maximum FOV to 160.<li class=spaced>Added missing blue/red Jawa skins (all credits go to Radiuks for these - thank you!).<li class=spaced>Bowcaster now uses correct alternate fire sound effect.<li class=spaced>You can now hear other players' stun baton hum sounds.<li class=spaced>Siege countdown text now displays which round you are in.<li class=spaced>"You won/lost the match" sounds now play for all team gametypes.<li class=spaced>Changed default setting of <code>cg_thirdPersonCameraDamp</code> to 0.5.<li class=spaced>Added support for levelshots of various aspect ratios, e.g. <code>levelshots/ctf_xxx_16_9.jpg</code>.<li class=spaced>Fixed several base JKA bugs relating to homing rockets.<li class=spaced>On compatible (base_enhanced) servers, the homing rocket HUD is now properly synchronized with the server, and is now 100% accurate. If you see/hear that you have locked onto a target, you can trust that your rocket is 100% guaranteed to home toward the target.<li class=spaced>On <em>NON</em>-supporting servers, the homing rocket HUD is now much more accurate (though not 100% accurate).<li class=spaced>You now automatically reconnect upon getting kicked by a reliable commands error.<li class=spaced>Added enhanced support for following teammates while dead in Siege on base_entranced servers.<li class=spaced>Trimmed useless silence from the beginning of many base JKA audio files that caused certain sound effects to seem delayed/lagged.<li class=spaced>Fixed several base JKA bugs relating to automatic weapon switching. Automatic weapon switching now uses a better order of weapon preferences and properly takes ammo into consideration. You can optionally customize the weapon preference order with the new <em>Weapon Preference</em> (<a href=documentation_misc.html#weaponpreference><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span><code>cg_weaponPreference</code></a>) cvar.</ul></div><p id=bugfixes><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><div class="doc-section well well-sm"><ul><li class="spaced spaced-top">Greatly reduced unnecessary use of internal cvars, which should help eliminate the MAX_CVARS crash.<li class=spaced>Fixed double crosshair bug in non-siege gametypes.<li class=spaced>Fixed the "ghost corpses" bug which allowed invisible corpses to block shots and detonate projectiles.<li class=spaced>Fixed dynamic crosshair sticking to your own rockets.<li class=spaced>Fixed the "phantom saber hum" bug, where you could occasionally hear saber hum sounds from dead players.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA bug that could cause erroneous saber sounds.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA behavior where your own vchat sounds would be stopped by jumping or rolling, despite other players being able to still hear it.<li class=spaced>Fixed disappearing health bar when rocketing destructable objects.<li class=spaced>Fixed bug with seeing your own eweb's health bar.<li class=spaced>Fixed bug causing you to change weapons upon spawning (particularly in siege).<li class=spaced>Fixed stretching of crosshair, HUD images, and some text on non-4:3 screen resolutions.<li class=spaced>Fixed siege techs seeing useless ammo bar when looking at teammates holding non-ammo-consuming weapons (lightsaber, melee, etc).<li class=spaced>Fixed bug with not hearing final objective complete sounds for base siege maps.<li class=spaced>Fixed EOF error when having a lot of custom siege maps installed.<li class=spaced>Fixed shaky dynamic crosshair in third-person view.<li class=spaced>Fixed improper prediction causing lag when moving next to emplaced guns or shields.<li class=spaced>Fixed specs not seeing health bars or hearing/seeing objective complete notifications.<li class=spaced>Fixed not being able to see player names while scoped.<li class=spaced>Fixed radar not showing while dead or following someone in spec.<li class=spaced>Fixed bugged displaying of teamvotes.<li class=spaced>Fixed crash when speccing a dead siege player.<li class=spaced>Fixed bug causing certain siege player models not to be precached at match start.<li class=spaced>Fixed spectators not being able to see map restart countdown.<li class=spaced>Fixed bug where obituaries were hidden if the dying player's name began with an asterisk.<li class=spaced>Fixed incorrect prediction of infinite charge bug.<li class=spaced>Fixed text in server info popup box getting cut off.<li class=spaced>Fixed low resolution of siege class icons when displayed at a small size (e.g. scoreboard).<li class=spaced>Fixed some base JKA bugs where parts of character models were invisible at certain angles.<li class=spaced>Fixed the base JKA "ghost corpses" bug which allowed invisible corpses to block shots and detonate projectiles.<li class=spaced>Fixed inaccurate third-person camera when riding animal vehicles.<li class=spaced>Fixed not being able to hear concussion rifle firing sounds in first-person view.<li class=spaced>Fixed improper alignment of base JKA crosshair #6.<li class=spaced>Fixed laggy movement near emplaced guns.<li class=spaced>Fixed weapon spawns sometimes flickering upon pickup.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA bug that cause mines and detpacks to appear to float slightly above the surface they are on.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA bug pertaining to single saber prediction on sloped surfaces.<li class=spaced>Fixed NPCs having choppy/laggy movement.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA bug that caused incorrect movement prediction when hit by rockets fired by a player with client number zero.<li class=spaced>Fixed a base JKA bug that caused siege vehicle turbo charge to display incorrectly if someone else had recently used turbo on a vehicle before you boarded it (on supporting servers).<li class=spaced>Fixed base JKA bugs that caused <em>Pickup Icons </em>(<a href=documentation_hud.html#pickupiconspickuptext><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span><code>cg_drawPickupIcons</code></a>) to disappear when switching weapons and remain on screen after dying.<li class=spaced>Numerous miscellaneous crash and bug fixes.</ul></div><p id=executable><h4>Executable-Dependent</h4><p>Some improvements can only be achieved by modifying the JKA executable (jamp.exe) itself. Such improvements have been coded directly into our custom improved executable, <a href=documentation_newjk.html><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>NewJK</a>. For the vanilla executable, Newmod "hooks" into memory to implement many of these improvements.<p>These features are <em>only</em> available on the vanilla executable and <a href=documentation_newjk.html><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>NewJK</a>; we do not advise using other executable projects (such as OpenJK or JAMME) with Newmod, as you will not get most of these features.<p>As the vast majority of Newmod users are now also using <a href=documentation_newjk.html><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>NewJK</a>, most newly developed features in this category do not have memory hooks for vanilla executable compatibility; such features are <em>only</em> compatible with <a href=documentation_newjk.html><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>NewJK</a>.<div class="doc-section well well-sm"><ul><li class=spaced>Significantly reduced input lag for all key presses and mouse movements.<li class=spaced>Enabled scrolling in console with mouse wheel.<li class=spaced>CD check bypass allows playing non-Steam JKA without the disc inserted.<li class=spaced><kbd>Enter</kbd> can now auto-complete commands from the main menus, instead of just from in-game.<li class=spaced>Unrecognized console commands are no longer sent as chat messages.<li class=spaced>Greatly increased the amount of text that can be stored in the console when you scroll up.<li class=spaced>Fixed lag when taking your first screenshot of the session.<li class=spaced><code>screenshot</code> command without argument uses timestamp for filename instead of base JKA numbering system.<li class=spaced><code>screenshot</code> command no longer requires quotation marks for custom filenames containing spaces.<li class=spaced>Server passwords are remembered and get automatically set when you connect to a server.<li class=spaced>Extended valid range of <code>cl_timeNudge</code> to allow values between -1000 and 1000. Negative values are automatically corrected to zero while spectating or following someone.<li class=spaced>Extended valid range of <code>cl_maxPackets</code> to allow values between -20 and 1000.<li class=spaced>Added help messages for cvars and commands.<li class=spaced>Removed ugly "RECORDING xyz.dm_26" text when recording a demo.<li class=spaced>Added support for orange and grey colors with color codes <code>^8</code> and <code>^9</code>.<li class=spaced><code>demo</code> command no longer requires quotation marks for filenames containing spaces.<li class=spaced>Removed ugly white box flash from some explosion effects.<li class=spaced>Added support for multiple master servers.<li class=spaced>Added ability to offset y-axis of console text feed, which Newmod automatically uses for spectator overlay.<li class=spaced>Fixed some duplicate effects bugs (e.g. seeing seven repeater shots when you only clicked once).<li class=spaced>Fixed jittery, ugly appearance of text at small font sizes.<li class=spaced>Fixed not seeing certain effects (including disruptor shots and tripmine lasers) if they originated behind you.<li class=spaced>Fixed some siege textures not producing proper footstep effects.<li class=spaced>Fixed <code>echo</code> command not properly preserving colors between spaces.<li class=spaced>Fixed crash when starting local server with widescreen resolution.<li class=spaced>Fixed crash when looking at Ragnos NPC.<li class=spaced>Fixed broken rendering with invalid primitives.<li class=spaced>Fixed connection hijack exploit on malicious servers.<li class=spaced>Fixed rendering of transparent colored/shadowed text.<li class=spaced>Fixed pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> during demo playback causing you to exit to the main menu.<li class=spaced>Malicious servers are prevented from forcing invalid/troll cvars on your client.<li class=spaced>The server list no longer considers colors and non-alphanumeric characters for sorting by name.<li class=spaced>Removed some annoying debug messages that would occasionally pop up on screen while playing.<li class=spaced>Removed the large amount of base JKA console spam that was printed in between maps.<li class=spaced>You can now pause demo playback by setting the <em>Time Scale</em> cvar (<code>timescale</code>) to <code>0</code>.<li class=spaced>You can now type percent signs and quotation marks into chat.<li class=spaced>The chat box is now limited to the actual maximum number of characters that servers will accept (149 digits). As you approach the maximum, it will display the number of remaining available digits.<li class=spaced>Fixed userinfo cvars not updating while the menus are open (e.g. typing <code>model reelo</code> with menu open).<li class=spaced>Disabled cinematics.<li class=spaced>Fixed bugs with typing accented/special letters in non-English keyboards.<li class=spaced>Fixed bugs relating to seeing and sniping extremely distant players, particularly in CTF.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> You can now bind key combinations using an <kbd>Alt</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier key. For example, <code>bind ctrl+x kill</code> will make <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> perform <code>kill</code>.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> You can now bind the <em>right-side</em> <kbd>Alt</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys separately from the <em>left-side</em> keys. For example, <code>bind rctrl kill</code> will make the <em>right-side</em> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key perform <code>kill</code>. Don't worry, your existing configuration is still 100% compatible — if no binding is specifically set for the right-side key, then the generic binding is used. The left-side key always uses the generic binding.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> fixed mouse getting stuck in the center of your screen when minimizing JKA immediately after startup.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> you can now play on JKA version 1.0.0 servers.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> you can now play on "pure" servers regardless of your mods by using the new <em>Pure Bypass</em> cvar (<a href=documentation_misc.html#purebypass><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span><code>fs_pureBypass</code></a>).<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Nested quotation marks are now supported in commands and binds, allowing for easier and more robust configuration. This allows entering commands like <code>bind a "bind b "set c "d ; e" ; say "hello there"""</code><li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> fixed laggy/buggy behavior and "Connection Interrupted" when playing with high latency with a high <em>Max FPS</em> (<code>com_maxFPS</code>).<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Fixed sounds bugging out and looping during "Server is changing maps".<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Increased the limit for gamma (<code>r_gamma</code>) from 3 to 10.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Improved how sounds are handled while minimized. Sounds are now allowed to freely start, progress, and finish while minimized; they are simply inaudible. No more minimizing during a sound and then hearing the rest of it when you maximize five minutes later.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Added new <em>Delay/Wait Freely</em> commands (<a href=documentation_commands.html#delaywaitf><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span><code>delay</code>, <code>waitf</code></a>), which are enhanced versions of the base JKA <code>wait</code> command.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Added support for additional keyboard shortcuts in the chat and console: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Backspace</kbd>/<kbd>Del</kbd>/<kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd>, as well as their <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> variants.<li class=spaced>Team Heal and Team Energize binds (<code>force_healother</code> and <code>force_forcepowerother</code>, respectively) are now automatically swapped whenever appropriate. For example, if you press <code>force_healother</code> (the TH command) while dark, it will perform TE.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> The JKA window in your taskbar now automatically renames to display match time, scores, number of connected players, chats, etc., allowing you to monitor server activity while minimized by simply looking at the NewJK window name in your taskbar. You can optionally disable this with the <em>Window Name</em> (<code>cl_windowName</code>) cvar.<li class=spaced><em>NewJK executable only:</em> Fixed a base JKA bug that prevented some binds from working when pressed at the exact same time. This fix should make input feel more responsive, as you no longer have to worry about simultaneous button presses cancelling each other out. This fix also allows binding one key to both a light and dark power, like <code>bind x "force_absorb;force_rage"</code>.</ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><script src=js/copyright.js></script></div></div></div><script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js></script><script src=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=js/responsive-img.min.js></script><script src=js/scrollspy.js></script>
